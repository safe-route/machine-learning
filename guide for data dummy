I just found this dataset, do you think it can be used as a guide for our dummy dataset?
because I still have no experience making dummy data in cases like this
Plus, if you look at the link, it includes a direct map visualization, so it should be possible if you make this data an example for our dummy data

the feature i think it's quite complete for the location use the coordinate also

anyway maybe ill create dummy with mockaroo... or do you have any suggestion?
